# CPU Scheduling Simulator
## Overview
The CPU Scheduling Simulator is a Java-based project that allows users to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms. It is designed to provide an interactive experience where users can choose different scheduling techniques, input custom data or use predefined inputs, and visualize the scheduling process with metrics such as waiting time and turnaround time.

This project is structured to maintain modularity and scalability, with each scheduling algorithm implemented in its own class file. It demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Java and DSA concepts, making it a valuable addition to your CV.

## Features
## Input Modes:

Predefined Input: Quickly test the program with hardcoded data.
Custom Input: Input your own process details.
Supported Scheduling Algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS): Processes are scheduled in the order of their arrival.
Shortest Job First (SJF): Prioritizes processes with the shortest burst time.
Priority Scheduling: Processes are scheduled based on their priority.
Round Robin (RR): Fair scheduling using a fixed time quantum.

## Output Metrics:

Waiting Time for each process.
Turnaround Time for each process.
Average Waiting Time and Turnaround Time.
