# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
A Java-based project to simulate popular CPU scheduling algorithms with predefined or custom inputs. Designed to provide insights into process scheduling metrics such as Waiting Time and Turnaround Time.

## Features
#### Scheduling Algorithms:
#### First Come First Serve (FCFS)
#### Shortest Job First (SJF)
#### Priority Scheduling
#### Round Robin (RR)

## Input Modes:
Predefined Input for quick testing.
Custom Input for user-defined process details.

## Metrics:
Waiting Time
Turnaround Time
Average Metrics
